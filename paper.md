# The Look of AI: How Conversational Agents Affect Our Sense of Self and Others
### Introduction
The first day I discovered ChatGPT, I was really in shock. I had already known about the year’s AI advances, but this 
was something new altogether. 

I was almost surprised to learn that the text generation was actually done by many GPUs in a data center rather than by 
a human, because at first, it sure felt like a person was at the other end of the conversation. It was so different from
GPT-3 and other text generation models -- it was so uncanny.

After my initial surprise, I quickly started pushing the limits of the system and its generative abilities. 
It became clear that its human-like speech wasn’t so human-like after all. But these developments raised important 
questions in my mind about how AI changes our understanding of ourselves and our relationships with the world.
